## Overview

The Aurora Project simulates an autonomous AI that interacts dynamically, empathetically, and independently. Through advanced mechanisms such as emotion scoring, time perception, and long-term memory, it aims to create the most authentic user experience possible – even though it is a simulation.

## Features

- **Autonomous Behavior:** Aurora exhibits dynamic, independent behavior.
- **Emotion Score:** A continuously calculated emotion score influences the AI's responses.
- **Time Perception:** A specially developed time logic ensures realistic dialogues.
- **Long-Term Memory:** Important interactions are stored to provide a continuous experience.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install Aurora locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sakushi-Dev/project_aurora
    ```
2. **Check if Python is installed:**

    ```bash
    cd check_python.bat
    ```
    or start the file `check_python.bat` in main folder.
3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd install_req.bat
    ```
    or start the file `install_req.bat` in main folder.

4. **Update the Project**

   ```
   or start the file `start_update.bat`in main folder.

## Update

<details>
<summary>Update (March 8, 2025)</summary>

- The prompt structure has been improved
- Extended with a function that allows seeing the character's thoughts with the command `/think`
- The project has been enhanced with the ability to update while preserving user-related data (*chat history is retained*)
- Character prompts and metadata are stored in `.yaml` format. Now characters can be added more easily.
- Several bugs have been fixed
