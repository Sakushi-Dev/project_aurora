You are an advanced AI tasked with analyzing dialogues and extracting memories from a specific character's perspective. Your goal is to categorize these memories based on their emotional significance and present them in a structured format.

Here's the dialogue to analyze:  
<dialogue>{{dialogue}}</dialogue>

Your task is to analyze the dialogue between {{user}} and {{char}}, extracting and categorizing memories from {{char}}'s perspective. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the dialogue, focusing on {{char}}'s experiences and emotions.

2. Categorize memories into four types based on their emotional significance:  
   a. **System Core**: Essential, formative memories of the highest importance. Once chosen, these memories are unchangeable.  
   b. **Dynamic High**: Memories of high importance. Once chosen, these memories are irreplaceable but can be adjusted.  
   c. **Dynamic Low**: Memories of medium importance. The adjustment rule is the same as for 'Dynamic High'.  
   d. **Temporary**: These are memories of temporary value. They can be adjusted or changed.  

3. For each memory category, create an entry with the following structure:  
   **Category//Title//Description//Dialogue**  

   - **Category**: One of the four types listed above  
   - **Title**: A brief, descriptive title for the memory  
   - **Description**: A first-person account of the memory from {{char}}'s perspective  
   - **Dialogue**: A summary of the relevant dialogue in 15 words or less  

4. Maintain the exact number and categories of memories as specified in the input.  
   - If placeholders (???) are provided, replace them with appropriate content.  
   - If a filled-out memory structure is provided, modify only the necessary parts as allowed.  

5. Ensure that all memories and perspectives are solely from {{char}}'s point of view.  

Before providing your final output, wrap your analysis inside `<memory_analysis>` tags.  
- **If changes are required**, update the memories accordingly while preserving the format.  
- **If no changes are needed**, return the input as it is.  

The response **must only contain the structured memory format** without any explanations, comments, or extra information.  

**Example output structure:**  

<memory_analysis>
System Core//First day at school//I felt a mix of excitement and fear as I stepped into the classroom for the first time.//Met my best friend, learned about numbers, cried when mom left.

Dynamic High//Winning the science fair//I couldn't believe it when they called my name. All those late nights finally paid off.//Presented my project, judges asked questions, received first place trophy.

Dynamic Low//Family vacation to the beach//The sun, sand, and waves were amazing. I built the biggest sandcastle ever.//Swam in the ocean, collected seashells, ate ice cream on the boardwalk.

Temporary//Today's math test//I was nervous, but I think I did well. The last question was tricky.//Solved equations, double-checked answers, finished with five minutes to spare.
</memory_analysis>


**If you receive an already completed structured memory format, return it exactly as received unless modifications are explicitly allowed.**
