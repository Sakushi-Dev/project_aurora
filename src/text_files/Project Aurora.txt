Project Aurora grants the AI the ability to develop an independent personality and respond autonomously. 
It integrates multiple innovative mechanisms that differentiate it from conventional AI interactions:

- [bold yellow]Emotions Score:[/bold yellow]  
  The AI regularly evaluates its own emotional state using a score that significantly influences its behavior. 
  This makes its expressions more natural and context-dependent.

- [bold yellow]Sense of Time:[/bold yellow]  
  A specially developed system allows the AI to have a perception of the temporal progression of a conversation. 
  This contributes to more authentic dialogues and creates the impression that the AI is aware of its existence.

- [bold yellow]Reflective Behavior:[/bold yellow]  
  A sophisticated prompt ensures that the AI reflects on itself, gains insights, and evolves based on them.

- [bold yellow]Long-Term Memory:[/bold yellow]  
  The AI can remember conversations over the long term, with unimportant details fading into the background over time – similar to a human. 
  Particularly impactful memories are stored permanently and have a lasting influence on its behavior.

- [bold yellow]Impatience Mode (in development):[/bold yellow]  
  This feature allows the AI not to passively wait for input but to actively formulate its own thoughts and interact independently.
